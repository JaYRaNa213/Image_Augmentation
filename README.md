Image Augmentation Using TensorFlow/Keras
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to perform image augmentation using the ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow/Keras. Image augmentation enhances the diversity of image datasets and improves model generalization in machine learning.

🌟 Features
Implements various augmentation techniques, including:
Rotation
Width and Height Shifting
Rescaling
Shearing
Zooming
Horizontal Flipping
Brightness Adjustment
Processes two datasets:
Clean Water Images
Microplastic Images
Saves augmented images to specified directories for further use.
📁 Folder Structure

⚙️ Requirements
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy pandas
🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Image_Augmentation.git
cd Image_Augmentation
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Ensure you have the datasets available:

Clean Water Images in /content/1_Clean_Water
Microplastic Images in /content/2_Microplastics
Run the notebook cells to perform image augmentation. The augmented images will be saved to specified output directories:

/content/drive/MyDrive/.../Clean_training_AUMENTED
/content/drive/MyDrive/.../Micro_Plastic_AUGMentation
Review the augmented images in the output directories.
