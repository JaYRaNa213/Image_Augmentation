#Image Augmentation Using TensorFlow/Keras
This repository demonstrates the implementation of image augmentation techniques using the ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow/Keras. These techniques aim to improve the diversity and generalization of image datasets for machine learning projects.

#Project Overview
Image augmentation is a crucial step in preparing datasets for deep learning models, especially when limited data is available. By applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping, the dataset can effectively simulate a broader variety of real-world scenarios. This project focuses on:

Augmenting datasets for "Clean Water Images" and "Microplastic Images".
Saving augmented images to specified directories for future use.
Leveraging TensorFlow/Keras for preprocessing and augmentation.
#Features of This Repository
##Data Augmentation
Image augmentation is applied to expand the dataset and prevent overfitting. Key augmentation techniques include:

##Rotation: Randomly rotates the images.
##Width and Height Shifting: Adjusts the position of images.
##Rescaling: Normalizes pixel values to scale them between 0 and 1.
##Shearing: Applies shearing transformations to the images.
##Zooming: Performs random zoom operations.
##Horizontal Flipping: Flips images horizontally.
##Brightness Adjustment: Alters image brightness within a specified range.
#Dataset Augmentation
This repository demonstrates augmenting the following datasets:

Clean Water Images
Microplastic Images
Output Directory
Augmented images are saved into specified directories for later use:

Clean Water Images Augmentation: /content/drive/MyDrive/.../Clean_training_AUMENTED.
Microplastic Images Augmentation: /content/drive/MyDrive/.../Micro_Plastic_AUGMentation.
